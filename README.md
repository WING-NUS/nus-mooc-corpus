# NUS MOOC Transacts Corpus
This is an annotated corpus of discussion forum threads from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The annotations are grounded on a pedagogy based discourse framework that adapts from and codifies 'transactivity' as proposed by Berkowitz and Gibbs, 1983. This is a simplified adadpation of their pedagogical/psychology based coding scheme, for instructor posts and replies in MOOC discussion forums.

We also propose inter-annotator agreement measures for a piecewise crowdsourcing annotation task to annotate the forum discussions with our modified taxonomy of transactive interventions.

However, due to privacy concerns and copyright claimed by MOOC platforms such as Coursera.org, we have encrypted the data. We also reserve the rights for access, use and distribution of the data.
